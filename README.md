# Inventory-Replenishment-Policy-Optimization-Using-Data-Analytics
Analyzed and optimized inventory policies using 4 months of transaction and sales data. Segmented SKUs using ABC classification and implemented replenishment models.
Key Features:
•	Processed 19K+ rows of transaction data; identified 516 A-items (80% revenue).
•	Applied (s,Q) model to top 10 A-items and (R,S) to 20 B-items with 80% service level.
•	Reduced monthly replenishment cost by 73% ($2,182 → $583).
•	Built and validated models in Python using demand forecasting and cost optimization.
Tools & Skills: Python, Excel, ABC Classification, (s,Q)/(R,S) Models, Cost Optimization
